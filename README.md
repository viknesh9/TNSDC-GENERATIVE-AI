Heart Disease Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Network

Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify patients into different categories based on health attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate, indicating varying degrees of coronary artery disease. The dataset used in this project consists of information from 270 patients and is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction

Install the required libraries:

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb to see the project code and results.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
Modify the model architecture or hyperparameters as needed for experimentation.

Results

The trained CNN model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on the given health attributes.

Future Work

Explore additional CNN architectures and hyperparameters to further improve the model's performance.
Investigate the use of other datasets or additional features for better prediction accuracy.
Deploy the trained model as a web application or integrate it into healthcare systems for real-time predictions.
